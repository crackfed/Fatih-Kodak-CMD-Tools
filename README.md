Original cmd apps by Fatih Kodak

These are programs written by Fatih Kodak. The original license accompanying these apps is contained here. To my knowledge these apps always have and still are made available under that licence. What is not known to me is the current status of Fatih Kodak. I have reason to believe he has voluntarily ceased to participate in one aspect of online presence in favor of another.  

My own personal interest in this collection of programs is tied to my effort to use many of them in the development of AwSim.bat or AwSim.cmd which is a utility specific to the online game Command and Conquer: Tiberium Alliances.
